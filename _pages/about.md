Hello! I am a student focusing on artificial intelligence. I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the College of Artificial Intelligence at Jilin University, and a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from the National University of Defense Technology.

My research interests include *Data Mining, Graph Learning (GNNs), Anomaly Detection, Multimodal Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), Domain Adaptation, Unsupervised Learning, Few-Shot Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.*

<span style="background-color: yellow; color: blue; padding: 2px;">I am seeking a Ph.D. position and hope to find a professor with an available opportunity. I promise to live up to expectations and work diligently.</span>
