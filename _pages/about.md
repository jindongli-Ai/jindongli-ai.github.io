Hello! I am currently a Ph.D. student at Thrust of Artificial Intelligence at [HKUST-GZ](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Menglin Yang](https://yangmenglin.site/). I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the School of Artificial Intelligence at JLU, and a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from NUDT.

My research interests include Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), with a focus on:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
  -  LLM Agent
  -  Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG), GraphRAG
  -  Code Generation
  -  LLM Editing
  -  others
- Geometric Learning with LLM, Geometric Foundation Model, Geometric Alignment
- Graph Learning (GNNs)
- Anomaly Detection (AD)
- Recommender System (RecSys)
- Multimodal Learning (MM), Vision-Language model (VLM)
- Domain Generalization (DG) and Domain Adaptation (DA)
- Unsupervised Learning, Few-Shot Learning
